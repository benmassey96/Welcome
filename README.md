### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, an aspiring Software Engineer from Hereford, UK. I've completed Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer course, so I've dabbled in a lot. I tend to lean towards favouring front-end development, with a fondness for game development, as a bit of a gamer myself.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a map application called Gazetteer!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React. I have touched on it before, but I realise how crucial it is, so I'm looking to hone my skills
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™d love to collaborate on front-end projects
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so much so that I have a Star Wars tattoo!
