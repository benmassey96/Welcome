### Hi there 👋

I'm Ben, an aspiring Software Engineer from Hereford, UK. I've completed Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer course, so I've dabbled in a lot. I tend to lean towards favouring front-end development, with a fondness for game development, as a bit of a gamer myself.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a map application called Gazetteer!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React. I have touched on it before, but I realise how crucial it is, so I'm looking to hone my skills
- 👯 I’d love to collaborate on front-end projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so much so that I have a Star Wars tattoo!

As well as having completed Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer course, I've also completed their introductory courses on: PHP, Java, C#, jQuery and Python. I'm looking to expand my portfolio and land my first job in the industry. 🏋️‍♂️
